# Classical Machine Learning Models

This repository contains simulations of ARIMA and the following 7 classical machine-learning models applied to regression problems:

- k-nearest neighbors;
- decision tree;
- random forest;
- support vector machine;
- least squares support vector machine;
- gradient boosting;
- LightGBM.

The ARIMA parameters are defined based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the hyper-parameters of the machine-learning models are optimized using grid search with cross-validation.

You can find more information about those models at the following link: https://kaikealves.weebly.com/classical-models.html.

This repository applies the cited models to benchmark series (Mackey-Glass, Nonlinear, and Lorenz Attractor), financial series (NASDAQ, S&P 500, and TAIEX), and finally, solar energy datasets, as following described.
